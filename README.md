## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- ADA

### What I learned

I am comfortable with toggled visibility in JavaScript. The main emphasis on this project was accessibility and I implemented most of the concepts.

### Continued development

I will continue to pay close attention to ADA standards and requirements. 

### Useful resources

- [MDN ADA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML) - This was the starting point for my knowledge.
